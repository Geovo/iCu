Hey, this is just my learning material. 

I began to learn 'C' a few weeks ago and now I'm currently working with Dennis Ritchie's Book "The C Programming Language", which I call "The Bible of 'C'".

That's why there is a "jizuz" folder, because that's kinda the role Dennis Ritchie played in the life of 'C'.

There is also a nooby folder, where I just store all my noobish (for now) code.

To learn 'C' you have to write 'C' and think 'C'.


The test folder contains a small ruby app, that generates a tree of folders and files.

I'll improve it a bit later and then will probably make a gem out of it. 
I will definitely add some automated testing. As this was a fairly small app, I decided to be a 'cowboy coder' and not to give a s**t about testing. (P.S. I know that's unprofessional, don't worry)

There is 1 dependecy: "colorize" gem.

In the folder "the_hard_way" I store my code that I write with Zed Shaw's Book "Learn C the Hard Way". 
There's some badass code there :)

Feel free to use it, but I created this repo for convenience, as I work on 2-3 different computers daily and this way I'llhave more flexibility.

Thanks for reading!
Have a nice day :)
