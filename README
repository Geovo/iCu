Hey, this is just my learning material. I started to learn C a few weeks ago and am currently working
with Dennis Ritchie's Book "The C Programming Language", which I call "The Bible of 'C'".
That's why there is a "jizuz" folder, because that's kinda the role Dennis Ritchie played in the life of 'C'.
There is also a nooby folder, where I just store all my noobish (for now) code. To learn 'C' you have to write 'C' and think 'C'.
The test folder contains a small ruby app, that generates a tree of folders and files. I'll improve it a bit later and then will probably make a gem out of it. 
There is 1 dependecy: "colorize" gem.
In the folder "the_hard_way" I store my code that I write with Zed Shaw's Book "Learn C the Hard Way". 
There's some badass code there :)

Feel free to use it, but I created this repo for convenience, as I work on 2-3 different computers daily and this way I'llhave more flexibility.

Thanks for reading!
Have a nice day :)
